DATA LOADING AND CLEANING

Loaded the dataset using pandas.
Handled missing values,inconsistencies, and ensure that data types are correctly set for analysis. 

EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS(EDA)

Descriptive Statistics: Compute summary statistics to understand the data distribution (e.g., number of accidents by severity, by weather conditions, etc.).

Time of Day Analysis: Analyze the frequency of accidents based on the time of day (e.g., morning, afternoon, evening, night) to identify peak times.

Weather and Road Condition Analysis: Explore how different weather conditions (e.g., clear, rainy, foggy) and road conditions (e.g., wet, dry, icy) affect accident rates.

Spatial Analysis: Plot accidents on a map to identify hotspots (locations with high accident density).

DATA VISUALIZATION

Visualize the dataset we got by cleaning and analysis by using HeatMap,Piechart,Bargraph,histplot and jointplot
